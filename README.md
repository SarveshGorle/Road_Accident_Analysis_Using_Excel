# Road_Accident_Analysis_Using_Excel
About This Excel dashboard project focuses on road accident data, aiming to create a user-friendly visual summary of accident details, severity, and weather conditions. The dashboard provides quick insights for informed decision-making and analysis in the context of road safety.
##Data Overview
In this Excel dashboard project, we'll use a dataset containing information about road accidents. Our goal is to create a visual, user-friendly dashboard that summarizes accident details, severity, weather conditions, and more. This dashboard will provide quick insights for informed decision-making and analysis.
##Data Cleaning
We've ensured data accuracy by removing duplicate entries from the dataset. To enhance data analysis, we've also created a "Month" and "Year" column from the "Accident Date" data, allowing for easy filtering and visualization based on these temporal dimensions. This data transformation ensures that the dashboard provides more meaningful insights and simplifies data exploration for users.
